DO NOT CHANGE THE TXT FILES PROVIDED MY CEETIS!!!
THE SCRIPT CAN BE RUN IN THREE MODES:
1. Automatically processes the results of the most recent test conducted in chronological order and produces the final report. (AUTO_TEST)
2. Selecting one or more tests by navigating through the directory (INTER_TEST)
    In the second case (INTER_TEST), the following options can be selected:
    * Which and how many tests among all those present in the directory ./input/FULL_TEST_su_cavo_ps_pp1_V3
    * Whether to plot one or more results together for comparison
    * The results of which type of test to plot (continuity, isolation, or both)
    * If you want to plot also LV cables resistence versus time
    * If you want to also produce the final report.
3. From command line by typing:
   * ./CMScables --input [PATH_TO_TXT_FILE] --mode [OPTION]
   * [OPTION] = 0,1,2 --> 0 for continuity, 1, for isolation, 2 for both. Default is continuity test.
***************************************************************
HOW TO ADD NEW TESTS TO PLOT:
1. The .txt file produced by the CEETIS software should be copied into the directory ./input/FULL_TEST_su_cavo_ps_pp1_V3/CABLE_NAME/
2. The .pdf file produced by the CEETIS software should be copied into ./input/pdf_ceetis/
3. The .ini files produced by the CEETIS software should be copied into the directory ./input/FULL_TEST_su_cavo_ps_pp1_V3/CABLE_NAME/VALORI/DATE_OF_THE_TEST/

****************************************************************
OUTPUT INCLUDES:
1. Final report in the directory ./output/report/
2. Produced plots, saved in ./output/plots/SingleCable/ if only one test was selected, or in ./output/plots/CheckCable/ if multiple tests were selected.
3. .root file containing all the histograms, including those not plotted in the report, saved in ./output/rootFiles/
4. LV/LVR cables resistence versus time in ./output/plotsTimeResistence/

The output names are composed of TEST_NAME__PROGRAM_EXECUTION_DATE_AND_TIM.pdf/root

*****************************************************************
PLOTS FOR LV CABLES VERSUS TIME:
plots for LV cables resistence versus time acquisition can be drawn as well. 
To attach also these plots in the final report in the automatic mode you should compile using:
make OPTION=AUTO_TEST TIME_RES
